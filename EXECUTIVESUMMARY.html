  Every two and a half minutes   someone in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, accounting for about one in four cancer deaths. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is less than one in five (18.1 percent) - much lower than those for many other common cancers, making it the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Why is lung cancer so deadly? Partly because most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at a later stage, when the disease is less curable. Therefore, much more must be done to address this horrible disease.
</p>

<p>
  A strategic imperative of the American Lung Association is to defeat lung cancer, and to do so, we need a multipronged approach that engages a variety of tactics and stakeholders to address the disease, its risk factors, public policy efforts and public health protections, and  access to lung cancer screening and more.
</p>

<p>
  The LUNG FORCE “State of Lung Cancer” report identifies potential interventions and also provides a state-specific understanding of the burden of and opportunities to address lung cancer.
</p>

<p>
  The report also serves as both a guide post and rallying call, providing policymakers, researchers, healthcare practitioners, as well as patients, caregivers and others committed to ending lung cancer with a one-stop resource for identifying where their state can best focus its resources to decrease the toll  of lung cancer.  <span style="color: red;">INSERT PETITION CALL TO ACTION HERE</span>

<h5>The State-by-State Toll of Lung Cancer </h5>
<p>
  While we have seen some advancements  in personalized treatment thanks to biomarker testing, targeted therapies, and new methods of early detection, the burden of lung cancer is not the same everywhere. Treatment, exposure to risk factors, and access to screening facilities vary from state to state. To  save lives, it’s critical to both prevent lung cancer when possible and diagnose the disease at an earlier stage.
</p>
<p>
  By better understanding the impact of lung cancer at the state level, we can encourage interventions to save lives. This report considers the following measures of lung cancer burden by state: incidence, survival rates, stage at diagnosis, surgical treatment and availability of screening centers and identifies where each state ranks on each of these measures.
</p>

<h5>Incidence</h5>
<p>
On average, the higher prevalence of smoking, the more lung cancer cases in a state. <strong>Utah has the nation’s lowest lung cancer rates while Kentucky has the highest, which parallels the smoking rates in those states.</strong> Greater targeted and national tobacco control and prevention efforts are needed to reduce the rate of lung cancer cases.
</p>

<h5>Survival Rates</h5>
<p>
  The survival rate of lung cancer varies by state. Lung cancer has one of the lowest five-year survival rates among leading cancers because it is often not caught at an early stage when it is more likely to be curable. <strong>The five-year lung cancer survival rate was 20.0 percent nationally, ranging from 24.0 percent in New York to 15.9 in Louisiana.</strong>  Only 31 states track this important metric, which should be implemented by all states to enhance monitoring of lung cancer, as well as all other cancers.
</p>

<h5>Screening Centers</h5>
<p>
  New research has shown that lung cancer screening can catch more cases earlier and save lives. The availability of more lung cancer screening sites will increase screening access for patients at high risk, and have a positive impact on early detection and survival of lung cancer. <strong>Delaware had the most screening centers per million people at 21.1, while Utah had the fewest centers per million people at 0.7.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If half of those currently eligible were screened, an estimated 15,000 lives could be saved. For those ages 55-80 with a 30 pack year history   who still smoke or have quit within the last 15 years, screening with annual low-dose CT scans  can reduce the lung cancer death rate by up to 20 percent by detecting tumors at early stages when it is more likely to be curable. For screening to be most effective, patients must be able to access high-quality centers offering the service, such as those accredited by the American College of Radiology.
</p>
<p>
  When looking at survival rates, the analysis in this report showed that states with more accredited screening centers per capita have higher survival rates, with each additional center per million people being associated with a 0.3 point increase in the lung cancer survival rate.
</p>

<h5>Early Diagnosis</h5>
<p>
  The stage at which someone is diagnosed with lung cancer varies significantly by state. People diagnosed in early stages are five times more likely to survive. Unfortunately, only 18.9 percent of cases nationally are diagnosed at an early stage. <strong>The percent of cases diagnosed at an early stage was highest for Wyoming at 23.3 percent and lowest for Hawaii at 15.0 percent.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  States with the most screening centers per capita had a higher portion of patients undergoing surgery as part of the first course of treatment, with each additional center per million people associated with a 0.4 point increase in the percent of patients undergoing surgery. This is a small increase, but might be indicative of a larger trend.
</p>
<p>
  Patients who are not healthy enough to undergo the procedure or whose cancer has spread too far may not be candidates for surgery. Other treatments may be recommended instead of or in addition to surgery, such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. This report focuses on surgery because it is most likely to be curative.
</p>

<h5>Discussion</h5>
<p>
  The relationships between screening centers per capita and survival,  and  early stage at diagnosis and surgery are intriguing but at this time do not prove that more screening centers per capita lead to improvements in these outcomes. The data on stage at diagnosis and surgery used in this report is from 2009-2013. Lung cancer screening was first recommended in 2013, and not covered by insurance or Medicare without cost-sharing until 2015. These diagnoses occurred before screening was widely available, and before it was covered without cost-sharing.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, for survival rate, there is an additional five-year data lag that is required to track cases after diagnosis. Given these data limitations, the observed relationships suggest that additional factors are driving the number of screening centers per capita and survival, stage at diagnosis, and surgery. For example, states with higher quality healthcare  could be expected to have better lung cancer outcome measures and be more likely to have accredited screening centers. These data can serve as a baseline to track the impact of lung cancer screening on a host of measures, including stage at detection, and ultimately, survival.
</p>
<p>
  The analysis in “the State of Lung Cancer” serves as a baseline against which future data can be compared, which may be especially beneficial as progress is made on the implementation of lung cancer screening.
