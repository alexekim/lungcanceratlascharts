    Nearly a quarter of a million American will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, or one every two and a half minutes. It is the leading cancer killer in the United States, accounting for about one in four cancer deaths. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is less than one in five (18.1%), much lower than those for many other common cancers. Less than half of those diagnosed with lung cancer will still be alive a year later. Lung cancer can be prevented, and new research has shown that screening can catch more cases earlier and save lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the burden of lung cancer is not the same everywhere. Some states have much higher rates of new cases than others, or much lower survival rates. Treatment, exposure to risk factors, and access to screening facilities also varies from state to state.
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    This report summarizes the available data on state-specific lung cancer burden. It provides policy makers, researchers, health care practitioners, and anyone committed to ending lung cancer with a one-stop resource for identifying where their state can
    best focus its resources to decrease the burden of lung cancer.

<h4>Surgical Treatment</h4>
<p>
  Lung cancer can often be treated with surgery as part of the first course of treatment if it is at an early stage and has not spread outside of the lung and lymph nodes close to the lung. While surgery may not be an option for every patient, those who
  receive it as part of their initial treatment have higher survival rates than those who do not. Patients who are not healthy enough to undergo the procedure or whose cancer has spread too far may not be candidates for surgery. Other treatments may be
  recommended instead or in addition to surgery, such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="change">Connecticut had the 2nd best rate (out of the 48 states with data available) with 27.4% of cases undergoing surgery as part of the first course of treatment, a higher rate than nationally (21.0%).</span>
