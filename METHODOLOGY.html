<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The report includes state-specific measures of lung cancer incidence, adult smoking prevalence, radon zones, five-year survival, stage at diagnosis, five-year survival by stage at diagnosis, surgery as part of the first course of treatment, and accredited
  lung cancer screening&nbsp;centers.</p>
<p>States were ranked from best to worst for each cancer-specific measure. In addition, statements describing the distance from the mean for each specific state measure were crafted to convey a clearer understanding of how each specific data point falls
  within the national data range, and how the state data differs from the national&nbsp;average.</p>
<p>Statements such as "much higher than average" and "similar to average," were determined by dividing each measure (incidence, smoking, survival, stage at diagnosis, surgery, and centers per person) into two sets of five contiguous ranges; one set ranging
  from the maximum observed value to the national average, and the other from the national average to the minimum observed value. Data values were described by which category they fell&nbsp;into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The two lowest categories were classified as "much lower than&nbsp;average;"</li>
  <li>data values that fell into the third and fourth lowest categories were classified as "lower than&nbsp;average;"</li>
  <li>data values that fell into the two middle categories were classified as "similar to&nbsp;average;"</li>
  <li>data values that fell into the third and fourth highest categories were classified as "higher than average;"&nbsp;and</li>
  <li>data values that fell into the two highest categories were classified as "much higher than&nbsp;average"</li>
</ul>
