    Nearly a quarter of a million American will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, or one every two and a half minutes. It is the leading cancer killer in the United States, accounting for about one in four cancer deaths. The five-year survival rate
    for lung cancer is only less than one in five (18.1%), much lower than those for many other common cancers. Less than half of those diagnosed with lung cancer will still be alive a year later. Lung cancer can be prevented, and new research has shown
    that screening can catch more cases earlier and save lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the burden of lung cancer is not the same everywhere. Some states have much higher rates of new cases than others, or much lower survival rates. Treatment, exposure to risk factors, and access to screening facilities also varies from state to state.
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    This report summarizes the available data on state-specific lung cancer burden. It provides policy makers, researchers, health care practitioners, and anyone committed to ending lung cancer with a one-stop resource for identifying where their state can
    best focus its resources to decrease the burden of lung cancer.

<p class="chartExplain">
  The line in the chart shows that, on average, each one point increase in the smoking rate for a state equals an increase of 2.4 points in the lung cancer incidence (the number of new lung cancer cases) rate. <span class="CHANGEEEEEEEEE">For Louisiana the smoking rate is higher than the national average, while the lung cancer incidence rate is lower than what would be expected for this smoking rate, as shown by the Louisiana data point being below to the dotted line in the chart. This suggests that people living in Louisiana might have lower exposures to other risk factors besides smoking.

      <strong>Radon</strong> is the second leading cause of lung cancer. Radon is a colorless and odorless can seep into homes and buildings. Some geographical areas have naturally higher radon rates than others. The US EPA has set an action level of
      4 pCi/L. At or above this level of radon, the EPA recommends you take corrective measures to reduce your exposure to radon gas.

<h4>Early Detection</h4>
<p>
  Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scan is recommended for those who meet the high-risk criteria:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>55-80 years of age</li>
  <li>Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking (this means 1 pack a day for 30 years, 2 packs a day for 15 years, etc.)</li>
  <li>AND, are a current smoker, or have quit within the last 15 years</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Screening for lung cancer with annual low-dose CT scans among those at high risk can reduce the lung cancer death rate by up to 20% by detecting tumors at early stages when it is more curable. For screening to be most effective, patients must be able
  to access high-quality centers offering the service, such as those accredited by the American College of Radiology. Patients may benefit from a greater number of accredited centers in their state as can improve the chances of a center being nearby and
  their ability to get screened.

<h4>Lung cancer by the numbers</h4>
<div class="box" class="CHANGEEEEEEEEE">
  <p>
    Louisiana ranked 35th among all states with 3.6 accredited lung cancer screening centers per million people, worse than the national rate of 4.8 centers per million people. This shows there are a low number of screening centers throughout the state available to the high-risk population in Louisiana. This decreases the likelihood that an individual would have access to a screening center nearby, which could be a barrier to lung cancer screening.

<a name="surgicalTreatment"></a>
<h4>Surgical Treatment</h4>
<p>
  Lung cancer can often be treated with surgery as part of the first course of treatment if it is at an early stage and has not spread outside of the lung and lymph nodes close to the lung. While surgery may not be an option for every patient, those who
  receive it as part of their initial treatment have higher survival rates than those who do not. Patients who are not healthy enough to undergo the procedure or whose cancer has spread too far may not be candidates for surgery. Other treatments may be
  recommended instead or in addition to surgery, such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="CHANGEEEEEEEEE">Louisiana had the 43rd best rate (out of the 48 states with available data) with 16.9 percent of cases undergoing surgery as part of the first course of treatment, a much lower rate than nationally (21.0%).

<a name="summary"></a>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
  <span class="CHANGEEEEEEEEE">Both the smoking rate and lung cancer incidence rate in Louisiana are higher than average. The state also has fewer screening centers per capita, which could contribute to both its much worse than average rate of surgery during the initial round of treatment and much worse than average survival rate.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span class="CHANGEEEEEEEEE">Residents can lower their risk of being diagnosed with lung cancer, as well as the risk of those around them, through these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quit smoking, or don&rsquo;t start.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">If you or someone you know is ready to quit smoking, the American Lung Association is here to help. Our Freedom From Smoking program has helped over a million people quit smoking for good.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Higher tobacco taxes both encourage people to quit and prevent children and others from starting to smoke.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Well-funded tobacco control programs are an important part of helping people quit and keeping potential new smokers from starting.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Full coverage for all FDA-approved smoking cessation methods, with no barriers to accessing them, leads to more successful quit attempts.</li>
  <li>Make your house and car smokefree air zones, with no smoking allowed. Avoid places that are not smokefree, and advocate for smokefree air policies in restaurants, bars, casinos, or anywhere they are not in place.</li>
  <li>Check your house for radon, and learn what to do if levels are too high.</li>
  <li>Reduce your exposure to unhealthy outdoor air.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Stay indoors on unhealthy air days.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Support clean air policies, including no idling zones and emissions limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Maintaining a high number of quality, accredited screening centers will help ensure that both as many patients undergo surgery during their initial round of treatment and as high a survival rate as possible.
